# To Do
* add `fadeout` prop which lowers volume to 0 over time within last .5 seconds
* add generic mobile support. Not for css, but for touch controls
* add in slider rather than click-to-seek
    * don't use input[range] component since styling breaks on those in some browsers
    * maybe add double tapping to the audio button instead of single-tap
* add file-type support, so formats other than mp3 can be specified
    * might not actually be a problem, but still something to look into
